                Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out
                collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique
                properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.

                Cardano is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source. Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver
                more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven
                approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers

                Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or
                third-party interference.
                <br><br>
                These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property.
                <br><br>
                This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past
                (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middleman or counterparty risk.

                Litecoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Litecoin is an open source, global payment
                network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities. Mathematics secures the network and empowers individuals to control their own finances. Litecoin
                features faster transaction confirmation times and improved storage efficiency than the leading math-based currency. With substantial industry support, trade volume and
                liquidity, Litecoin is a proven medium of commerce complementary to Bitcoin.

                A digital token backed by fiat currency provides individuals and organizations with a
                robust and decentralized method of exchanging value while using a familiar accounting unit. The
                innovation of blockchains is an auditable and cryptographically secured global ledger. Asset­backed
                token issuers and other market participants can take advantage of blockchain technology, along
                with embedded consensus systems, to transact in familiar, less volatile currencies and assets. In
                order to maintain accountability and to ensure stability in exchange price, we propose a method to
                maintain a one­to­one reserve ratio between a cryptocurrency token, called tethers, and its
                associated real­world asset, fiat currency. This method uses the Bitcoin blockchain, Proof of
                Reserves, and other audit methods to prove that issued tokens are fully backed and reserved at all
                times.

                Today the world sends more than $155 trillion across borders. Yet, the underlying infrastructure is dated and flawed. Ripple connects banks, payment providers
