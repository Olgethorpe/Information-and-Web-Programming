            <p>
                A cryptocurrency exchange or a digital currency exchange (DCE) is a business that allows customers to trade cryptocurrencies or digital currencies
                for other assets, such as conventional fiat money or other digital currencies. They can be market makers that typically take the bid-ask spreads as transaction
                commissions for their services or simply charge fees as a matching platform.

                An example of an exchange would be similar to the image displayed below. Below is an example of a cryptocurrency exchange, also known as the GDAX exchange.

            <h2 class="header">The Concept of an Exchange</h2>
            <p>
                A digital currency exchange can be a brick-and-mortal business or a strictly online business. As a brick-and-mortar business, it exchanges traditional payment
                methods and digital currencies. As an online business, it exchanges electronically transferred money and digital currencies. Often, the digital currency exchanges
                operate outside the Western countries to avoid regulation and prosecution. However, they do handle Western fiat currencies and maintain bank accounts in several countries
                to facilitate deposits in various national currencies. Exchanges may accept credit card payments, wire transfers or other forms of payment in exchange for digital
                currencies or cryptocurrencies. As of 2018, cryptocurrency and digital exchange regulations in many developed jurisdictions remains unclear as regulators are still
                considering how to deal with these types of businesses in existence but have not been tested for validity.
                <br><br>
                The exchanges can send cryptocurrency to a user's personal cryptocurrency wallet. Some can convert digital currency balances into anonymous prepaid cards which can be
                used to withdraw funds from ATMs worldwide while other digital currencies are backed by real-world commodities such as gold.
                <br><br>
                The creators of digital currencies are often independent of the digital currency exchange that trade in the currency. In one type of system, digital currency 
                providers (DCP) are businesses that keep and administer accounts for their customers, but generally do not issue digital currency to those customers directly.
                Customers buy or sell digital currency from digital currency exchanges, who transfer the digital currency into or out of the customer's DCP account.
                Some exchanges are subsidiaries of DCP, but many are legally independent businesses. The denomination of funds kept in DCP accounts may be of a real or 
                fictitious currency.

            <h2 class="header">History of Exchanges</h2>
            <p>
                In 2004 three Australian–based digital currency exchange businesses voluntarily shut down following an investigation by the Australian Securities and
                Investments Commission (ASIC). The ASIC viewed the services offered as legally requiring an Australian Financial Services License, which the companies lacked.

                In 2006, US-based digital currency exchange business GoldAge Inc., a New York state business, was shut down by the US Secret Service after operating since 2002.
                Business operators Arthur Budovsky and Vladimir Kats were indicted "on charges of operating an illegal digital currency exchange and money transmittal business"
                from their apartments, transmitting more than $30 million to digital currency accounts. Customers provided limited identity documentation, and could transfer funds
                to anyone worldwide, with fees sometimes exceeding $100,000. Budovsky and Kats were sentenced in 2007 to five years in prison "for engaging in the business of
                transmitting money without a license, a felony violation of state banking law", ultimately receiving sentences of five years probation.

                In April 2007, the US government ordered E-Gold administration to lock/block approximately 58 E-Gold accounts owned and used by The Bullion Exchange, AnyGoldNow,
                IceGold, GitGold, The Denver Gold Exchange, GoldPouch Express, 1MDC (a Digital Gold Currency, based on e-gold) and others, forcing G&SR (owner of OmniPay) to liquidate
                the seized assets. A few weeks later, E-Gold faced four indictments.
                <br><br>
                In July 2008, Webmoney changed its rules, affecting many exchanges. Since that time it became prohibited to exchange Webmoney to the most popular e-currencies like E-gold,
                Liberty Reserve and others. Also in July 2008 E-gold's three directors accepted a bargain with the prosecutors and plead guilty to one count of "conspiracy to engage in money
                laundering" and one count of the "operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business". E-gold ceased operations in 2009.

                In 2013, Jean-Loup Richet, a research fellow at ESSEC ISIS, surveyed new money laundering techniques that cybercriminals were using in a report written for the
                United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. A common approach to cyber money laundering was to use a digital currency exchanger service which converted dollars into
                Liberty Reserve and could be sent and received anonymously. The receiver could convert the Liberty Reserve currency back into cash for a small fee. In May 2013,
                digital currency exchanger Liberty Reserve was shut down after the alleged founder, Arthur Budovsky Belanchuk, and four others were arrested in Costa Rica, Spain, and
                New York "under charges for conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy and operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business." Budovsky, a former U.S.
                citizen and naturalized Costa Rican, was convicted in connection with the 2006 Gold Age raid. A U.S. indictment said the case "is believed to be the largest
                international money laundering prosecution in history." More than $40 million in assets were placed under restraint pending forfeiture, and more than 30 Liberty
                Reserve exchanger domain names were seized. The company was estimated to have laundered $6 billion in criminal proceeds.

                Following the launch of a decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin in 2008 and the subsequent introduction of other cryptocurrencies, many virtual platforms were created
                specifically for the exchange of decentralized cryptocurrencies. Their regulation differs from country to country. In February 2014, Mt. Gox, the largest cryptocurrency 
                exchange at the time, suspended trading, closed its website and exchange service, and filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan from creditors. In April 2014, 
                the company began liquidation proceedings. This was the result of a large theft of Bitcoins that were stolen straight out of the Mt. Gox hot wallet over time, 
                beginning in late 2011
