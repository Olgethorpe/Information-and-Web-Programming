            <h2 class="header">Cryptocurrency: The Short Version</h2>
            <p>
               A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions,
               control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies are a kind of alternative currency and digital currency
               (of which virtual currency is a subset). Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.
               <br><br>
               The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.
               <br><br>
               Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is generally considered the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since the release of Bitcoin, over 4,000 altcoins
               (alternative variants of Bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) have been created.

        <h2 class="header">The History of Cryptocurrency</h2>
        <p>
            In 1983 the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic money called ecash. Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,
            an early form of cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it
            can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or a third party.
            <br><br>
            In 1996 the NSA published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a Cryptocurrency system first publishing it in a
            MIT mailing list and later in 1997, in The American Law Review (Vol. 46, Issue 4).
            <br><br>
            In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of "b-money", an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system. Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo created "bit gold".
            Like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange, BitGold) was an electronic currency
            system which required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published. A currency system based on a reusable
            proof of work was later created by Hal Finney who followed the work of Dai and Szabo.
            <br><br>
            The first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created in 2009 by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, as its
            proof-of-work scheme. In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which would make internet censorship very difficult. Soon after,
            in October 2011, Litecoin was released. It was the first successful cryptocurrency to use scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency,
            Peercoin was the first to use a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid. IOTA was the first cryptocurrency not based on a blockchain, and instead uses the Tangle.
            <br><br>
            On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had been commissioned to do a study of cryptocurrencies, and what role, if any, they can play in the UK economy.
            The study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered.
